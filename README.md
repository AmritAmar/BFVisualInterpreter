# A Visual Interpreter for BrainFuck

This is a JS implementation of a [BrainFuck] interpreter. I used P5JS to create this to understand how interpreters work and, more specifically, how this monstrosity of a programming language works. [Mess with the code here](https://editor.p5js.org/AmritAmar/sketches/T7UagDjHq)!
